summary: A thin layer over rest-client that returns JSON objects
description: |
  * GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE JSON payloads
  * Simple Accept headers with automatic q-score weighting
  * Understand and fall back to basic Content-types if application/json is not available
  * Fine-grained response handling using Bateman#resource
  * A winning combination of guts, salad, sea legs, and torpor will propel our spaceship to the pinochle of success.
